# NFL-Big-data-bowl-2025

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of NFL player movement data from the 2025 Big Data Bowl competition. The goal of the project is to extract actionable insights from player tracking data, which could be beneficial for coaches, analysts, and decision-makers within NFL teams.

Overview

The analysis focuses on merging and processing datasets to derive insights regarding player performance, formations, and movement. The primary datasets include:

Plays Dataset: Details of individual plays, including teams involved, down, and distance.

Players Dataset: Information about the players, including position and physical attributes.

Tracking Data: Week 1 tracking data detailing player positions, speed, and acceleration throughout the game.

The data was preprocessed, cleaned, and then utilized to train machine learning models to predict play outcomes. Our feature engineering process included creating new features such as average player speed before the snap, maximum acceleration, and encoding offensive and defensive formations.

Key Features

Memory Optimization: Reduced the memory footprint of the datasets by optimizing data types, allowing for efficient processing.

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Imputed missing values and derived new features to enhance predictive power.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key metrics such as player speed, position distribution, and play outcomes.

Modeling: Developed a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of a pass play. The model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 95%

Precision: 95%

Recall: 95%

F1 Score: 94%

Datasets

Plays Dataset: Provides detailed information on individual plays.

Players Dataset: Includes player-specific data, such as physical stats and positions.

Tracking Week 1 Data: Positional and speed information about each player, recorded in real-time.

Project Highlights

The model provides insights that could potentially be used by NFL teams for in-game decision-making.

The feature engineering included encoding complex formations and calculating movement metrics, making the analysis adaptable for week-to-week evaluations.

Charts and visualizations were included to provide an accessible summary of player performance and model predictions.

Results

The logistic regression model is capable of predicting the outcome of plays with high accuracy, which could be useful for coaches looking to understand play patterns and adjust strategies accordingly. The project has also been evaluated based on the following metrics:

Football Score: The analysis is aimed to provide insights that are directly actionable by NFL teams and league offices.

Data Science Score: The methods used are correct and the models are appropriately suited for the nature of football data.

Report Quality: The documentation is well-written and easy to follow, providing clear motivations for each analytical step.

Data Visualization: Innovative and accurate visualizations make complex player movements more comprehensible.

Future Improvements

Explore more advanced machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks to further enhance prediction accuracy.

Include more weeks of tracking data to generalize the model across a full season.

Integrate additional football-specific variables that influence play outcomes, such as weather and player fatigue.
